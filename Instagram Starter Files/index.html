    <h3>Capture and Share the World's Moments</h3>
    <p>
    Instagram is a fast, beautiful and fun way to share your life with friends and family.

    Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the world.

    Oh  yeah, did we mention it's free?
